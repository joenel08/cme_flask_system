2019,"I enrolled in AMA OED because my traditional school was in MSU Marawi. I don't want to study there anymore because of the conflicts and threats of security. Also, I have 2 kids already and I can't leave them. In my opinion, what has to be done is to proactively make a group chat in every course so we know people from the same course. Messenger GC is preferable because most people are in there anyway. I noticed on the FB page of amaoed that there are people inquiring and asking to be added to the GC and I think that's something that the school can provide instead. What has to be stopped is giving modules that are 50 pages or more for 1 lesson. The majority of students here online are people working. I had a module for 1 lesson that was 86 pages and I finished reading that in 2 weeks. I had to extend that subject because I was short on time. In cases like mine where I have to go to work and tend to my kids and study after, modules that are super long are very overwhelming and hopefully, this will stop.

2019,"I enrolled in AMA Online Education because I want to study at my own pace and I'm trying to avoid group activities that is very common in traditional school which caused me depression and anxiety because there are times that some students are not fair unlike in ama university where all you have is yourself to survive the school year. Another thing is that I retracked my strand, I don't want to be an irregular student. The reason is that my previous track is very rare that it's hard to find a school that offers it. Honestly, I enrolled in this university for a while to finish senior high school. For the good points about ama university online education are: It is accessible anytime, anywhere. The grading is fair. The faculty members are very courteous. They allow students take quizzes or tests when they're ready. For the things to improve: Response to student concern. There are times when they don't respond at my concern at all. Marking correct answers as wrong. I've experienced this during exams, claiming my answer was wrong eventhough I know for sure that it's correct. It's a hassle experience since their response to my concern is usually delayed. Irrelevant content of exam. There are times when the questionnaires in exam are not included in the module or video lecture or powerpoint presentation which caused me to just guess the answer sacrificing my grade. It wasn't a situational question but identification. I posted a student concern but they never seem to answer my question clearly. I was asking for a reference but they cannot give me one. Meaning to say, they also don't know what their exams' content are. Overall, it's still a good experience being an Ama University Online Education student.",All Units,Why did you enroll,,

PLEASE START: Having QUALITY video modules for every course. I was enrolled previosly in Calculus 1, and I was very disappointed since the quizzes and assignments were very hard and the module does not provide a concrete foundation in answering the quizzes. It's hard to explain your concern in the lesson in E-mail, one time, I requested someone that I could ask in Team Viewer so that I could ask and receive questions real time. The video lecture there has little connection to the lesson and does not help in answering the quizzes. They did not use the opportunity to use the video lecture to explain the solutions in the module. Sometimes, in some subjects, the activities that we are required to do is harder than that in the module. Sometimes, the correct answer in the quizzes are wrong, and was not discussed in the module. I hope that you provide quality learning materials for EACH subject. Because what we pay for each subject is hard earned. Thank you. Note: I do hope that Calculus 2 and 3 and all the Major subjects provide QUALITY materials thank you. STOP: Having quizzes and activities that are too hard than the module discussed. Also, some mentors, (not all) just reply something just to close your ticket but does not provide quality answers to the questions being asked. KEEP: Please keep mentors like Prof. Marydel, who is assigned to Computer Programming 1 and Cisco 1 and 2.

Please stop Professors from treating students like it's high school and insulting students. For example, if I submit a project 5 times to a professor making his recommendations for changes and clearly doing it right, but he just says ""it isn't good enough"" and can't even give a logical reason except.. ""I think you can do better"".. is so unacceptable. This is a completely subjective assessment, meaning useless. This is college, it should've been graded accordingly, but this unqualified college educator gave an F based off of one small 50 point project when I had clearly passed the course.. and it's a GE course.. this is crazy, it really is.. So please stop Professors like this.. it is quite damaging to AMA to have Professors like this. This Professor is Russel Tolentino by the way. Keep up the content of the Computer Science courses..

The fee for every class is kind of expensive, and I'm not sure if the school offers scholarship for the students who has GPA of 2.50 or better. Hopefully, the school can offer a scholarship. However, the cash discount still helps.",All Units,Why did you enroll,,
2020,"I enrolled in AMA because I am a full-time employee for an IT-based BPO company and I am also a mother of 2 children. I need to work to provide for my kids and I can only study at certain times that's why I enrolled - to take advantage of flexible school hours. START - I wish AMA can start implementing the removal of OJT for full-time employees like me. It was a challenge to find my work, let alone get accepted for the work I have now. I have amazing employees and I need this work for my family. I don't know if this suggestion is already in effect but if not, I suggest that students that are full-time employees can submit their COE's to provide proof. It took a lot of time to establish myself in my work and it's difficult to leave. STOP - Stop taking a lot of time to respond to student requests. For example, I had requested for my Major Elective 1 subject to be Object-oriented programming and instead, I was enrolled in Project Management. It's been a couple of days and I still don't have the correct subject. KEEP DOING - Keep giving different types of discounts to students. It's very difficult to earn money these days, the COVID pandemic has hit hard. I hope more discounts will be available in the future.",All Units,Why did you enroll,,

I cannot complain as almost 90% I was always responded politely. I don't have any recommendation for you to ""STOP"" doing but maybe on Keeping Up the good work in handling your student's inquiry. Also you can START being very considerate about your students working outside the country, minding their time zone differences, and as usual for example if given Saturday and Sunday were holidays in Philippine, but we have Friday here in Middle East, Maybe at least there's available correspondent for our inquiry so we will not wait Monday for them inquiry to be answered. Also kindly start to organize a tutoring Mentor so that we will not go to another site to ask for inquiry, even if it will be paid, at least we have someone to respond immediately if we are confused. Maybe you can include it in the offer for the payment. As I know that all Mentors were busy as well.",All Units,Why did you enroll,,

And most of my class requires outside activity, especially in NSTP. You should also consider that I am a domestic helper who only abides by my employer's policies. Online learning is very different from the usual university setup students are very dynamic, which I think you should also learn to adapt.

As an undergraduate (1st year college) some of the school providing online class/study only accept those fresh graduate of high school and/or with K12 curriculum. As I've experienced before(P.E subject mostly) STOP making the students upload their exercises video on YouTube as part of the requirements to continue the module. Yes, it is okay to make an exercises video as part of the curriculum but make sure you have a safe platform related to the school and protected. YouTube is not part of AMAUOED. I got a sketchy reply before from the professor regarding the matter. Giving deadline of submission but not updated to check the practical test on the said date of checking. Double check the questions of quizzes because some of them are wrong grammar to make it more harder, repeated questions and wrong answer form the choice which is not even mentioned on the module.

It's to help them or us, clear our minds, have a clear look for our future to avoid those job mismatch and the likes. Since it's online school, students are just at home, maybe some of them are feeling bored because of being at home always, for example me. I didn't think that I'll going to study here because Im already enrolled. But, there are things thst you cant control. I miss going out, i miss being a regular student.

2019,"1) Virtual classes for harder courses like GMAT-111, STAT-111, et cetera. These courses are harder in general. Math courses are easier to understand if there's virtual classes being handled weekly. This will also resolve the unnecessary uproar happening in the forums of GMAT-111. 2) Self-paced program option for students who can handle coursework better than his / her classmates. This is based on UST-Angelicum College's system. I am a product of the said institution's self-paced program. I've finished two academic years in 9 months because I can comprehend material better than my classmates. 3) More practical activities. Courses like EAPP, RWS, et cetera, should require practical outputs since these courses are practical itself. This will utilize the students' skills on the said courses. 4) Anonymous student complaints. Some students are aware of concerns that should be addressed where his / her identity should not be revealed to the violator regarding violations made by violators so that justice can take place. 5) Course and mentor evaluation for grade 11 courses. I have noticed that some courses in grade 12 has course and mentor evaluations. It should be done to grade 11 courses as well so it can be improved. 6) Grade requirements for entering students. Home study programs are harder in general because we are expected to learn the material itself. Thus, we should minimum grade requirements like no line of 7's, above 80+ average, etc. 7) Academic recognition for SHS students. Students within the honor hierarchy should be recognized and be given the mandatory medals required by the DEPED. 8) Graduation coinciding finishing residency. We should graduate within the year we finish our requirements within the residency given not 200 days per semester. I do think that students will not graduation since we're attending college after that.",All Units,Program to be launch,,

2019,"I would say that the enrollment process is straightforward. In fact, the turnaround time for enrollment has improved. I was already enrolled the same day as I paid my first installment. It's sad though that the 4000 per Major has been implemented recently for BSBA MIS. This is already making me pinch every penny I have for school. :(",All Units,Program to be launch,,
2019,its good.,All Units,Program to be launch,,
2019,"The enrollment procedure was ok, the administrators helped us entirely during the process & helped us. The tuition payment process for OFWs were a little tricky we hope they can let us use credit cards like (JCB, MASTER, AMEX etc.) after all it is an education for all beyond borders, so having to pay and take a day off just to pay for the tuition fee is a little hassle for me, we hope I can pay thru other credit cards options.",All Units,Program to be launch,,
2019,I like the enrollment procedure. It's fast. You should get the portal completely fixed becaus when my subjects are activated it shows my old and new subjects.,All Units,Program to be launch,,

2019,"It was pretty fast and good , over all its improving since the first time I enrolled 3 years ago.",All Units,Program to be launch,,
2019,"The enrollment procedure can be followed easily, but it HIGHLY depends on your assigned OED BUDDY. My first buddy was very responsive and communicates very well specially since I use email as my main channel of communication with them. The ones that replaced her are very robotic, with nothing but automated responses. Thank goodness I learned most of the procedures like enrollment with my first oedbuddy.",All Units,Program to be launch,,
2019,Everything went well and the response are in timely manner. So far so good.,All Units,Program to be launch,,

2019,Fast and easy.,All Units,Program to be launch,,

2019,"Regarding to the enrollment process, I think the process is good however, it will be better if there will be one complete information or a link (payment, exam rules, requirements for graduation etc. ) about the course before enrollment so there will be an overview of the whole course and process as it will also make the information accurate and reliable. So by the time a student is ready to enroll he/she has already prepared all the needed documents and will be able to allocate his/her time wisely per subject in line with his own timeline especially for those who are working which makes distance learning more convenient and hassle free.",All Units,Program to be launch,,
2019,"Awesome experience, it's just that the math subjects are really hard to understand. You should have virtual professor who can teach online with schedule as well for math subjects.",All Units,Program to be launch,,

2019,Everything was smooth,All Units,Program to be launch,,
2019,I would like to suggest having a single admission adviser in each enrollment period. I would also suggest that the portal be flexible wherein discounts could be applied as well.,All Units,Program to be launch,,

2019,"My experience in enrollment procedure was good and fine. the process was smooth, maybe because i have a good adviser,RICA, that help me alot in the enrollment procedure. KUDOS to RICA, for being supportive and responsive, and very helpful through all the process. maybe add PAYMAYA as a way of payment in the tuition fee. thats all.",All Units,Program to be launch,,
2019,"How was your experience with our enrollment procedure? The enrollment and payment process is convenient although I would encourage you to accept more modes of payment like American Express which you still don't support. You only accept Visa and Mastercard through PayPal. Are there any processes that you would like to suggest, enhance, or omit to improve our enrollment system? Not at this time. Although, you may want to improve the portal to make sure the information posted there are updated e.g. enrollment status, payment, subjects, documents submitted and approved etc.",All Units,Program to be launch,,
2019,"The enrollment procedure was smooth , all the student buddies were so helpful, the Professors were also very attentive to emails, the call centers were always there for the question, What I wanted to suggest is to add more call centers to attain on Saturdays and sundays as those were working days in some other countries as well.",All Units,Program to be launch,,

I shifted in ABPsych course from BSBA-MIS. After enrollment my subjects has been activated, when I already started my Entrepreneurship subject here comes the new sets of additional subjects because I told my OEd buddy that some activated subjects were credited on my previous course that's why they changed those subjects into a new one then they did necessary things to solve my concern. The Entrepreneurship has been deleted yet no any information or message coming from whoever just to explain why do they need to delete the said subjects since I already started it. Now, another thing happened when I enrolled yesterday June 11, 2019. In my surprise my PHYED121, ENGL 102, NSCI101, PAGSULAT AT PAG-BASA TUNGO SA PANANALIKSIK, are still activated after the confirmation email coming from Student Support. My final grade in PHYED121 is the same as what grade I have in College Algebra yet not same in equivalent.

2019,"Bad as always but I just take it with understanding since its online. I find the OEd Buddy useless because he cant help me coordinate my concern. Though I make sure that my emails is short and complete with necessary information to process and can be forwarded to concern people if needed. I know that you guys are under one roof so you can make way to streamline the process. I end up like just giving the OEd buddy a heads up of my concern and will just advise me to direct my concern with people. He will not forward the message. So I need to create a new email. I lost a days to address my concern. His alibi is your system needs a ticket. Then when a professor reply back he will say that coordinate this with your OEd buddy. Then the buddy will say again direct your concern to your professor and create a new ticket. Its a chaos for me. The process is crazy who will address my concern. Suggestion You guys know that the your interaction with students are always just about checking of assignments (if any), enrollment (Gradeslip, loading of courses, payment, and activation) simply non-academic inquiries. Its rare that they we will ask for clarification of subject matter of the courses. So why not improve. These non-academic concerns I think is stated in the Student Handbook already and there are other concerns not yet defined. Why not create a facebook page (or a page link in the student portal) about announcements specific to a program (i.e. Computer Engineering Students like me). Announcement could be the following (because if all students will ask this one by one and reply to them each is so tiring and all of us have different pacing). This is like the General Orientation in traditional school. I think this will reduce your student concerns email inquiries dramatically. 1. Update on course availability with when will it be available (so we can plan our OEd life we assume that all courses are already available) . 2. Clarifications on courses (this can be committed since it can be part of course module guide). 3. FAQs",All Units,Program to be launch,,

2020,"The enrollment procedure was okay, although it took three days before my subjects were activated. I suggest that after a student finishes his or her term, grade slips will be automatically sent or uploaded in the portal for download. I also hope that the subjects for next term will be automatically loaded onto the portal, and then the student will just communicate with the adviser if he or she wants any changes. Otherwise, he/she can proceed with the enrollment. That way, the process is more seamless and quicker for the students. This avoids waiting for days in between enrollment.",All Units,Program to be launch,,

2021,"In lieu of how I got here, I suggest you continue to accept students without the need of entrance exams. I believe it is only right that an educational institution would encourage the enrollment of students, no matter their caliber, for it truly relies in their own desire to learn and develop that drives them to study and to enroll, so why hinder them if they don't reach expected levels of prerequisite knowledge? Surely, this same desire would drive them to study harder if they truly craved academic achievements, that they would overcome their own shortcomings. On the other hand, I also find the paying of tuition fees to be very easy. It doesn't force us to go enroll on specified dates and times, but rather, allows us plenty of freedom to enroll and start our course at our own pace. The instructions on how to enroll and pay tuition are also pretty straightforward and easy to follow.

2019,"Enrollment is frustrating, long, and tedious. Please stop the requesting of a gradeslip process.. there is no point, when the term ends it makes sense to just have it all graded and put in the system as final.. it's that simple. This just complicates the process and I'm from the U.S. and no college does such a thing.. it's just graded final as the term ended.. Everyone I tell back home is baffled when I tell them about this. My mom is a college administrator back in the U.S. and she tells me this causes so much inefficiency. It should just be automatic when a term ends that grades are processed in let's say a week, then in 72 hours new courses are added for the next term. This way the student just logs in and sees it all done and pays and starts.. this whole gradeslip, having to email saying you completed the term, and asking to have subjects uploaded.. it's so inefficient. Terms are 98 days... it seems like this can all be made simple by cutting out this process.",All Units,Pricing,,

2019,I think t was fine.,All Units,Pricing,,
2019,"Well, payment is extremely fast transaction however after payment subjects are still inactive and they let me pay even subjects are close while I waited for approval to enroll my subjects. How they approved the subjects to be enrolled while they are empty?

2019,"since the new portal came, all the procedure got so fast",All Units,Pricing,,
2019,My experience with the enrollment procedure is that it needs improvement. I would suggest if you could expand the modes of payment especially for those who lives abroad. I would also appreciate it if you improve the communication of our OED BUDDY. It was difficult to reach them and communicate.

For suggestions I guess it would be that there is a hotline that can be contacted. Currently there are contact numbers displayed - however when I try to call any number nobody would answer. But I guess this is due to the covid 19 that the work become skeletal so I understood and instead emailed by buddy about my concerns. ,All Units,Pricing,,

2019,"Enrollment procedure at first was hard because of some adjustments with the new portal, but Ms. Kelly was so patient with me and everything went smooth.

2019,"It was okay but I don't know why I've been charged for ""other fee"" aside from admission fee.   And as I've heard to the effectivity of your new system about the increasing of fees, I agree that the minor and major subjects are increasing and that is acceptable for me but about the technical fee and admission fee it's a bit too high for those enrolling 3 subjects per term like me. Every 3 subjects in 3 months(every enrollment) with technical fee will cost us a lot of money although many of us staying and working abroad, some of us are not working like me. I am staying home, jobless, I mean is I am taking care of my 2 kids. Hoping that, technical fee is like once or twice a year. twice a year is okay. NOT LIKE 3 SUBJECTS IN 3 MONTHS.  please fix the technical fee and admission fee concerns. TWICE A YEAR may work but 3 months with 3 subjects, I think it won't. Thank you",All Units,Pricing,,

The system assigned me for a course/subjects that I already took. It took at least a week to finish the enrollment.   The major complaint that I have so far is that some modules and quizzes aren't aligned properly. Some quizzes are way out of topic in the provided module and then it turns out that that quiz is for the following module in which I do not have access to. I would suggest to just review the alignment of course materials/assignments/quizzes properly so that it would be fair to us students.  The right answer to fill in the blanks questions should be shown too after the assignment/quiz/exam is over. In fact, I suggest that fill in the blanks should not be case sensitive.",All Units,Pricing,,

It also took a while for my subjects to be activated and replaced with working subjects.  Up to this day I have a subject that I already paid for and still has incomplete materials. It's been a month already since I enrolled.  Sadly, the entire enrollment procedure this semester  was a disappointment specially with all the new site and system. It was way better before.

I passed my Form 137 from my previous school which proves that I was already finished with my Grade 11 but when I asked my OED Buddy PaulBryan Velasco last March 2020 about the graduation details then he told me that it is too early for me to ask for the details since I'm only taking Grade 11 subjects. I was supposed to graduate from Senior High last year but because of the Evaluation Team's mishandling, I got delayed by a year. Imagine how stressful and problematic it is on me and my family's side. As for the compensation, I only got 5 FREE SUBJECTS which we think is not enough for what happened. The evaluation Team and OED Buddy Kelly did not even reach out to us properly to negotiate, they just decided to give 5 FREE SUBJECTS which is very unfair to our side.

2019,"Modules and assessments are a hit or miss, honestly speaking. Though many of them proved to be very good. If I have to name a prof, I'd say if the mentor/prof is prof Russell, I know that the course will be very well made. There are many modules and assessments that I have difficulty figuring out due to lack of information or bad grammar. In fact, I got penalized a couple of times in quizzes because of this.",All Units,Pricing,,
2019,good,All Units,Pricing,,
2019,The modules were ok but the others subjects were really unnecessary subjects like ETHICS. The history of AMA should be read and not to be studied like it is part of a curriculum.,All Units,Pricing,,
2019,I like the modules except for the subject about taxes. I didn't understand how to solve some problems but aside from that I like the modules and assessments.,All Units,Pricing,,
2019,All coursewares so far are very helpful and easy to understand.,All Units,Pricing,,
2019,"During my first year that was 2016 it was a little bit unorganized, there was a gilts. I remember there was a problem once with the video lessons. But as time passes it improves a lot.",All Units,Pricing,,
2019,"Very good but needs more polish on math related courses. There were a lot of bad formats for equations, missing symbols, and irregular text sizes.",All Units,Pricing,,
2019,The coursewares are organized but there are some instances some questions will be asked before the next subject will be discussed.,All Units,Pricing,,
2019,The modules are very long that makes it boring so if there's a way for the instructors to make the modules more interesting.,All Units,Pricing,,
2019,Its easy to understand.,All Units,Pricing,,
2019,I just experience during the exam that the selection/choices appreared twice in the Item and I do not what was the real answer because the review link is locked.,All Units,Pricing,,
2019,The materials used are very useful and contents are complete.,All Units,Pricing,,
2019,It is good.,All Units,Pricing,,
2019,"It is still a little bit expensive for an independent mother like me. Especially if our kids are studying as well. It would be nice if 20,000 is for your 3 semesters already. And maybe you can try to stretch the payment for 6 instalments. every 15 days is quite too short.",All Units,Pricing,,
2019,Great experience especially during my IT Capstone with the help of my Thesis adviser Prof. Josephine Casin and with other mentors in DB- Ms. Mary Soriano great modules.,All Units,Pricing,,
2019,"Modules, Presentation and video Lectures along with Assesments are all excellent. Im still studying my course , So far I have no problems.",All Units,Pricing,,
2019,thats fine with me,All Units,Pricing,,
2019,"I am always relying on the course modules, based on my experience it is more detailed and most of the test questions are taken there. There are times that there is only one courseware available which is the module.",All Units,Pricing,,
2019,"Pretty good, just lacking video lectures specially on math subjects.",All Units,Pricing,,
2019,"Proofread modules before delivering it, there are misspelled words, elaborate some of the topics especially the challenging ones, and from time to time it will help to change exam and quizzes questions too.",All Units,Pricing,,
2019,It's an ok experience although some of the subjects dont show answers after doing quizes and assignments it would be helpful for us students what we got wrong by showing it to us instead of making us guess what we made a mistake on. Also i would like more in depth examples on subjects that require mathematics and programming to help the students understand the lesson clearly without rushing into the quizes with few examples to work with.,All Units,Pricing,,
2019,"I'm very happy with the courses offered, modules, presentation, videos, lectures, and assessment.",All Units,Pricing,,
2019,My experience is good in terms of the course.,All Units,Pricing,,
2019,good,All Units,Pricing,,
2019,Impressive,All Units,Pricing,,
2019,Helpful. Detailed. Easy to understand,All Units,Pricing,,
2019,"I can say that sometimes I am having a hard time in some modules because when examination time, found out that questions are not in the modules.",All Units,Pricing,,
2019,I just hope that all the modules can be downloaded so that if there is no available data or internet connectivity. We can still read and review the lesson offline.,All Units,Pricing,,
2019,They are great and usefull,All Units,Pricing,,
2019,"Some modules does not explain the lesson clearly , thus needing more research.",All Units,Pricing,,
2019,I didnt have a problem with the offered coursewares.,All Units,Pricing,,
2019,Very good,All Units,Pricing,,
2019,Awesome!,All Units,Pricing,,
2019,"For courses that entail formulas and equations I suggest to provide us students with detailed comprehensive video lectures on how to solve given problems , similar to the video lectures provided in Physical education.",All Units,Pricing,,
2019,I am a newbie here and I think It will help m a lot.,All Units,Pricing,,
2019,the modules was great. but some words are misspelled. maybe edit it a bit so there is no error in spelling.,All Units,Pricing,,
2019,"How was your experience with our offered coursewares? Example: Modules, Presentations, Video lectures, and Assessments Kindly have a quality analyst review your modules as some need improvement especially with grammar and typos. Some exams also have errors that you may have overlooked and its quite tedious to report it one by one so most of us just let it pass.",All Units,Pricing,,
2019,"The modules were mostly useful, presentations are on point, assestments are quiet straight forward which were essentials for us students but video lectures were so rare.",All Units,Pricing,,
2019,Some Modules were too long to absorb and bit confusing. Exams were mostly hard and less of time allotted. It's totally challenging.,All Units,Pricing,,
2019,My overall assessment on the courses is they are good. they are informative. there are just instances that the answers on the quizzes can only be found on the next module which we cannot read in advance.,All Units,Pricing,,
2019,very helpful,All Units,Pricing,,
2019,It was easy to understand but sometimes the quizzes are too sensitive. Some answers wanted the plural form while some wanted the singular form. It would be nice if that was stated in the instructions.,All Units,Pricing,,

First Law of Motion = Law of Inertia), in such cases, it would be better to just provide choices. - Some questions are repeated - Some questions do not contain the answer provided by the choices - After answering the assessments, for some I can still go back and review them, but for some, it doesn't allow me to.",All Units,Pricing,,

It will be easier if you highlight all the important details. Are the presentations the ones that you have to have a linkedin account?

The video was of the presentation being flashed while the reader reads the module.

Furthermore, the course module I had encountered had an alarming amount of grammar error.",All Units,Pricing,,

2019,it was very nice and it was all very detailed but I recommend that you should have accredited the subjects that Senior High School Students took during their SHS days to lessen the stress level and also to lessen the payment for their units.,All Units,Pricing,,

I somehow have a problem with the Video lectures. some have muffled sounds (although I'm not really sure if it's a problem with the video quality or with my internet connection) all in all, the materials are really helpful. also, a big thumbs up to your e-library. it's like internet heaven.

2019,I was pleased with your modules and the idea that everything was digital. Only comment was that some questions in the assessments were advanced - meaning they were already in the quiz even though they haven't been discussed yet. Only to find out that the topic was in the next module.,All Units,Pricing,,
2019,Good.,All Units,Pricing,,
2019,Good but why I cannot save them in my own for my future reference? If I paid tuition I think as student the manuals should provided to the student.,All Units,Pricing,,
2019,I would say that some modules are good and some are not. I don't like subjects having to play a lot of videos from lynda.com. I just feel its not conducive for learning and there's a tendency for the student to get bored. Reading and interactive materials are good.,All Units,Pricing,,

2019,To be honest the professional courses and core courses (IT and Engineering courses) are presented poorly. But that's ok even the top traditional schools in the country are also like that. The good thing is we can always search the internet for other resources and we have the flexibility to do our way and the module topic serves as guide what to look for. Over all OEd wins because we have time to explore things.,All Units,Pricing,,

(week one and loaded near 98 days), so I raised my concern regarding this issue, they replied that this module will be needed in the next weeks. But it was never needed because the next weeks they loaded completely different modules, with several different references again. There are many other issues that I had come along, but I took them as part of imperfections and flaws that can just be ignored and tolerated.",All Units,Pricing,,

2019,"My experience to them are pretty good and fun. I like the way the course outline is presented and organized. It helped me track them with their respective checkboxes, but there are more improvements that can be made like in Video tutorial(not lynda) for example can be enhance by attaching a similar tutorial text file that can be read instead of watched and heard like a video. Modules and presentations can be enhance as well if a standard PLEASING visual design can be implemented down to the downloadables and other files.",All Units,Pricing,,
2019,"Its good but sometimes there are subjects that does not provide any modules especially the IT subjects that we need to take and I as for the majority of the enrolled in this program are living a very busy schedule. So, just having a video is not really a good thing. All subjects must have their modules for reading because it is easier to read during breaks at work than listen to videos that we might forget about and nothing to refer to or do a little review with before taking the activities.",All Units,Pricing,,
2019,"I didn't have any issues with the modules, video etc. I suggest to provide more examples esp. With the major subjects.",All Units,Pricing,,

I suggest that you update the website especially all the identification part where we need to type in the answers.",All Units,Pricing,,
2019,They were great but I prefer modules over video lectures. I live in Tokyo and trains get a bit crowded during peak hours so having to watch video lectures are a bit of a hassle. (I study on the way to work.),All Units,Pricing,,
2019,"The coursewares greatly presented the lessons covered by each subject. Some are reader friendly, while others are not. Some are too boring too read. Maybe there is a better way to present the lessons.",All Units,Pricing,,
2019,"DIFFICULT. ESPECIALLY DURING RAINY AND TYPHOOM SEASONS WITH POWER OUTAGES NO INTERNET CONNECTIONS, I CANNOT COPY THE MODULES SO I COULD PRINT IT AND JUST READ THEM IN TRAFFIC WHILE COMMUTING OR LUNCH BREAKS IF AT WORK. IT IS HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON INTERNET CONNECTION WHEN IT COMES TO REVIEWING, I CANNOT SAVE THE MODULES OFFLINE. MODULES ALWAYS HAVE GRAMMATICAL ERRORS THAT DISTORTS THE MEANING AND INTEGRITY OF SOME SENTENCES IN THE LESSONS WHICH ARE VERY MISLEADING AND CONFUSING, NOT ALL STUDENTS CAN KEEP GUESSING. THE MODULES ARE VERY OLD FASHIONED, FAILS TO INCLUDE THE ALREADY ESTABLISHED LATEST EXAMPLES, NEWEST RESEARCH AND CATEGORIES THAT DEBUNK THE OUTDATED BIASES FROM THE OLDEST WORKS IN PSYCHOLOGY. IT IS ALSO LIMITED IN THE IMPORTANT INFIRMATION THAT IS CRUCIAL IN BAR EXAMS, WHILE INCLUDING UNNECESSARY INFORMATION WAY TOO MUCH. TOLERABLE BUT NIT ALL CAN KEEP TOLERATING BECAUSE SOME OF IT ARE TOTALLY WRONG. PUBLISHING WRONG FACTS IS BAD ESPECIALLY COMING FROM AN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION.

2020,"This is for all the subjects in general. I hope all the subjects can offer live/recorded lectures so to make the learners feel more like they're in a classroom setting. I've attended a recorded lecture in Computer Programming 2 and I commend the teacher for teaching well, cracking jokes and making the class more engaging. For video lectures, I hope that all the teachers can sound energetic and interested in the topic, not bored, and to not make it too obvious that they are just reading the modules. They could do a quick summary of the topic while covering all the important points to give a brief introduction to the topic, or they could discuss the topic in-depth and explain in their own words, giving their own examples. Teachers should also make sure that they are reading things right to sound more professional and not distracting. Music is okay and spices things up but don't let it overpower the voice of the teacher. I also suggest adding visuals to video lectures so it can be more interesting. I suggest the modules and quizzes be checked for grammar usage because some things are hard to understand when the grammar is wrong, leading students to get wrong understanding/knowledge. For modules, not all supplementary/reference links have hyperlinks that can be easily clicked to go there.

You also might want to start with the question box / chat our professor box (with specific available time for the professor's convenience) so we can directly ask them regarding the subject questions we have. There are some questions I would like to raise but I don't know whom to reach so the chat your professor box will be a great help. What you should stop is having 3 different options to take the lesson. I mean, i know it's good that we have options, but one way or another, the other option / module has incomplete details. Can we just have one module, containing all the details of the lessons that we need so it will be easier to study. Also, please cross check the lesson, There are subjects like Filipino, that I'm struggling to understand. The mere fact that the subject itself is already hard, typographical errors are making it worst for me. It frustrates me to read tagalog lesson with typo errors and grammatical errors.

I'm happy with how detailed and easy to read most of the courses are (except some modules where there are several grammatical errors that frustrated me a little) but I'm not very happy with how the courses work this time around. Like, I miss when I have access to all the modules and I can choose what lesson I want to study first and leave a check mark on it when I'm done. It just puts a little pressure on me to have to finish a specific lesson before I can move on to the next one. But that's just me.",All Units,Pricing,,

Also, I have some technical subjects enrolled this term, computer related ones, so, I am not yet sure how that would go. It's still too early to say. I do have one subject last term, Business Ethics, where the actual key terms on the module do not match the terms in the exams. For example, business ethics is the term used in the module, and in the quizzes, what you'll find is corporate morals. I find that the modules in which too many big words were used weren't that effective. I believe it should be more precise and straightforward so that the point comes across clearly to the student.",All Units,Pricing,,

When i finished the quiz and then went back to the options, I checked the video lectures and the questions provided in the quiz is on the video lectures however it was not written but discussed by the person on the recording.

It could be just my lack of mathematical background, but it would be helpful to provide more examples for students to more effectively understand how some formulas and logical processes work, especially since we are expected to study the material on our own, if not with the help of our mentors.

2021,"In the modules, my kind suggestion is that it should be precise and concise as possible or to be short and crisp as like me, an employed student, having hard time to study of every module will be 30-50 pages. It will end up not reading all the context as I have no choice and running out of time. Additionally, since it’s a module, it’s wordy. It’s better to add some infographic context in the module to convince the readers.",All Units,Pricing,,
2021,"I think what you should START doing is recording classes of a subject where the professor discusses it. Discussion is still everything. These recorded discussion will really help us a lot. Also, live chat or live forum for a particular subjects is advisable too. Since AMA is known for technical courses, creating a MOBILE App is go so we can really have the grasp of studying while we are outside. You can also recommend particular books or articles to be read. Having a direct contact to our professors would be great too than waiting 24-48 hours. What you should STOP doing is eliminate all video lectures. Seriously speaking, I never opened one again after the first time I did because the voice is just literally reading the modules without further explanations. I thought it was a recorded discussion or something. What you should keep doing is the modules. Though I have to admit it's not the best but it's simple enough to understand.",All Units,Pricing,,

The PRESENTATIONS and VIDEO LECTURE are good no problem at all. But the ASSESSMENTS sometimes are annoying because mostly of the the questions are out of the topic only few are in the topic and also having a problem with the time limit. I think you should START providing modules that are not too long I mean please take out those topics that not too important.

2021,Some of the subjects have limited modules and resources hope you could include more of these in the future,All Units,Pricing,,

2021,"it is nice and efficient. they make sure students can easily understand their lessons,",All Units,Pricing,,
2021,"START - making modules condensed and clear. Some modules are full of long, unnecessary details that only leads to confusion. KEEP - letting the students know what items they got incorrect/correct - those type of quizzes that don't leaves us literally in a void of 'what happened?'. STOP - putting questions on quizzes/exams that aren't on the material given because there's nothing else to do but guess when put in this specific spot [where did the teaching and learning occurred in that circumstance? absolutely none]",All Units,Pricing,,

2021,"Overall it is excellent. It's just that some modules have incorrect grammar and incorrect spelling of words included, so, might as well double check the modules before uploading it.",All Units,Pricing,,
2021,"In summary, it is fairly mediocre. Students who haven't been under a Home Study Program would struggle to filter out important information on any given academic material.

2021,Your offered courses wares is good. And I can access it anytime.,All Units,Pricing,,
2021,"At first I thought the modules provided all of the information about the subjects but later on I realized that it was a ""summarized/compressed"" copy of the book or the whole topic. A PDF copy of the complete version of the book would be very much helpful for reading purposes especially for those students who wish to take the board exam after graduation. The video lectures will be more effective if it was in a documentary form/any other forms instead of the Professors just reciting what was in the modules.",All Units,Pricing,,

2021,The experience ive got on the courses was good also. Everything was clearly explained.

2021,The other subject was good but as of now Im having hard time in my NSTP2 and the Other extra Activities In Physical education because I'm ofw and it's very hard for us to do the other requirements in NSTP2.

2021,"Some of the modules and quizzes are written poorly - not observing the correct grammar. Some of the materials seem incomplete.

2021,"so far, most of my subjects were really easy to understand and take notes from but I did have difficulty learning the lessons in ""Introduction to World Religions and Belief Systems"" and ""Physical Science"". In world religions, the topics chosen were great and seemed interesting but I did have a problem when the module only composed of an intro, reading assignments and questions to think about. I find the intro to be really good and more interesting to read than the reading materials. I would have preferred if the reading assignments were made into sources and the prof had used it as basis and explain further making it easier to understand by a student. the materials aren't that bad some are just too long to read, most can't be found without a link and some are just too difficult to understand without a good explanation. in physical science, I just didn't think the the modules and the exams and quizzes complimented each other. I felt as if I didn't learn anything because I either I cannot remember typing it on my notes or I know for a fact that I didn't read anything about it in the prior modules. I was very upset because did study a lot and maybe just because I studied hard I was able to produce some educated guesses on some of the exams and quizzes.",All Units,Pricing,,
2021,Since I experienced the Bridging Programs which is limted only with 7days. it made me find myself difficult catching to read all the lessons in modules as a working student but it helps me a lot to understand the lesson. i hope it will extend into 2weeks if possible.,All Units,Pricing,,

I was enrolled previosly in Calculus 1, and I was very disappointed since the quizzes and assignments were very hard and the module does not provide a concrete foundation in answering the quizzes. It's hard to explain your concern in the lesson in E-mail, one time, I requested someone that I could ask in Team Viewer so that I could ask and receive questions real time. The video lecture there has little connection to the lesson and does not help in answering the quizzes. They did not use the opportunity to use the video lecture to explain the solutions in the module. Sometimes, in some subjects, the activities that we are required to do is harder than that in the module. Sometimes, the correct answer in the quizzes are wrong, and was not discussed in the module. I hope that you provide quality learning materials for EACH subject. Because what we pay for each subject is hard earned. Thank you. Note: I do hope that Calculus 2 and 3 and all the Major subjects provide QUALITY materials thank you. STOP: Having quizzes and activities that are too hard than the module discussed. Also, some mentors, (not all) just reply something just to close your ticket but does not provide quality answers to the questions being asked. KEEP: Please keep mentors like Prof. Marydel, who is assigned to Computer Programming 1 and Cisco 1 and 2. I hope that every mentor in AMAOEd is just like her who provides quality answers, answers in a timely manner, and has a genuine concern for the student to learn. Thank you.

2019,"I was afraid this question would be asked. All problems I have had with modules, lectures, and assessments were typed into the class review forms. Those that I can remember off hand are: MATH211: There are a lot of problems in the modules where equations were not printed properly leaving students to see an equation having no exponents when the answer suggests that an exponent was, indeed, used. Also, the video lectures were absolutely useless in MATH211. They had no bearing at all on what the module was covering and gave no value at all to the class. The video lectures should show several examples of equations and how they are figured out with further explanations than were given in the modules. Finally for MATH211 there was a point where the assessments and quiz did not match the material covered. The exact chapter and what was being taught are listed the review I made for the class. PHYED121: The questions in the assessments and quizzes did not fully reflect what was being taught in the modules. Sometimes the questions would have an answer that was different than the module stated and sometimes it would ask questions about materials that would not be covered until one or two modules later.

2021,"PLEASE START: Having QUALITY video modules for every course. I was enrolled previosly in Calculus 1, and I was very disappointed since the quizzes and assignments were very hard and the module does not provide a concrete foundation in answering the quizzes. It's hard to explain your concern in the lesson in E-mail, one time, I requested someone that I could ask in Team Viewer so that I could ask and receive questions real time. The video lecture there has little connection to the lesson and does not help in answering the quizzes. They did not use the opportunity to use the video lecture to explain the solutions in the module. Sometimes, in some subjects, the activities that we are required to do is harder than that in the module. Sometimes, the correct answer in the quizzes are wrong, and was not discussed in the module. I hope that you provide quality learning materials for EACH subject. Because what we pay for each subject is hard earned. Thank you. Note: I do hope that Calculus 2 and 3 and all the Major subjects provide QUALITY materials thank you. STOP: Having quizzes and activities that are too hard than the module discussed. Also, some mentors, (not all) just reply something just to close your ticket but does not provide quality answers to the questions being asked.

2019,"Mentor helpfulness is very much dependent on the individual professor. My experience has shown that the professor for MATH211, CS202, and PHYED121 were not exactly helpful. For CS202: when grading an assignment where there were errors in the program the professor simply stated that there were errors and to fix them. It is quite obvious that if a student submits a program with errors then they do not understand how that part of the program works. Instead of simply saying ""fix it"" the professor should review that part of the code and give the students some tips and explanations on what is causing the errors so they can understand the error, it's cause, and how to fix it. For MATH211: there was a point where the professor asked for pictures of the assignments. When submitted, the professor refused to grade it saying that not all the information was there. 1: this is a computer college. The professor should have the work done ON THE COMPUTER not submitting pictures. Also, if there is a certain format or information that he want's on the assignment then it needs to be made clear what is expected and have an example ready so students do not waste their time doing work that will not be graded or be graded as a 0. For PHYED121: the professor tried to be helpful by answering my notice that assessments and quizzes were not reflecting the right answers or were asking questions about material not covered until later in the class. However, her efforts made the matter worse. The questions asked were wrong, questions were still reflecting material not yet covered or that were never covered in the class.",Content,Experience with  Offered Course Ware,,

One example was with my work immersion professor, Ms. Charlene Mae Palma, who received my tickets but sometimes didn't receive my replies through email. This is probably an issue with the ticket system but I can't tell for sure. Another issue with mentor replies is with my admission adviser, Paul Velasco, who took so long to reply to our concerns regarding enrollment. My father and I both added him on Messenger and bombarded him with messages every day during my enrollment and it always took him 2-3 days to respond. He said it was because he was tending to a lot of other students trying to enroll, but that doesn't seem like a proper excuse that a school should make to someone who is trying to enroll. Furthermore he almost only replied to my father, not paying much attention to me, the student. He would only reply to my concerns when my father also messaged him telling him to reply to my messages.",Content,Experience with  Offered Course Ware,,

2019,Start with improving communications between classmates and also to get the professor actively involved in communicating when a student has a query or is unsure of why they may be getting questions wrong in tests etc. This needs to change if we are to be able to learn properly in an online capacity.    One other issue I know students are not happy with is the additional charges being added halfway through a course when students have already made a budget for what is already a quite expensive course and structure (given comparative lack of personal interface with professors and teachers etc) This is considered unfair not only be me but I can see generally across the board.    ,Mentor,Mentors Helpfullness ,,

On traditional school, my Professors are not specific which comes first as long as we understand the lesson. Although, on your part it is a good skill for us to learn but give us a consideration on that matter. 2) The online buddy should be knowledgeable with regards to the programs and services of AMA OEd; and approachable since we (the students) have many concerns. 3) lastly, to improve the timeline on the subjects enrolled. Fourteen (14) weeks is not enough to finish the eight (8) to seven (7) subjects enrolled it should be lengthen because there are subjects that are too long to read.",Mentor,Mentors Helpfullness ,,

Some students find it hard to learn things from reading. In addition, I think having a platform for students like a discussion board for every courses would actually be great. Here, students can now interact with each other, this could also take off some load of the mentors. I think this should be topic based, a lot of online universities have mandatory discussions after each module so they can see if their students have really absorbed the lecture. Hopefully if this happens the mentor can participate in the discussion too. It’s hard to answer the evaluation when we have not really interacted with the mentor.",Mentor,Mentors Helpfullness ,,

For some instances, it would be hard for the students to answer that and might be a problem for those who wanted to keep their grades high. :) I think, in that case, everything must be checked accordingly before placing it in there.

The speaker literally just reads what's on the module, no further explanation. > Virtual classroom should be made for every subject. It's a must, be it no student will join or many students will. It's always should be available. The reason is, most of your students here just want a degree. BUT there are students who wants to learn. So if you're for a quality learning, don't look for your benefit. Look at OUR benefit because we're paying a good amount. We deserve the equivalent. > PROVIDE E-BOOKS. For my major, Psychology, there are subjects where we need books. Experimental, Abnormal etc. PROVIDE BOOKS WE REALLY NEED. To be honest, your virtual library doesn't work at all. Only for reference, but in terms of clarification and additional learning, it's not helpful. II. Schedule > When you promise 24-48 hours please do. We understand that you have a lot of inquiries, but when you promised 24-48 span to each of us, we will expect it. We are working, and time is very valuable. Even a day will impact our schedule. This is the first thing you should consider since you are an online school. III. Documents > Do you know that there are students who already submitted their documents but you claim you have not?

2019,"the areas that you should improve the exam timing for all the student of AMA OED. i suggest to add enough time for the student to take the exam. example for short quiz you give only 20 minutes you make it 1 hr meaning add extra hour if possible. like for me most of the time my connection is very slow what happen is it's give us more stress to answer the question. I had experience last night, hope you will implement since this is 1 attempt only. and for the lecture hope more on video's than to keep us reading if we finish our duty in the midnight and try to spend 1-3 hrs. we cannot focus instead make us feel sleepy.",Mentor,Mentors Helpfullness ,,

2019,"AMA should improve the communication between the teacher and students. Mentor should replied to the students at least 48 hours after sending their homework, and give feedback. Base on my experience, I have to push the teacher to give feed back on the work I submitted to them. Sometimes I have to wait 2 weeks, 3 weeks, one month, and sometimes more than two months. Suggestion: The mentors should have their own system to track the days and work of the students since we all know that most of the students at OED are working students too and to avoid coarse lapse.",Mentor,Mentors Helpfullness ,,
2019,i found everything good.,Mentor,Mentors Helpfullness ,,
2019,"I'm not an education expert, and the way I see it is but from a student's perspective. My observation does not necessarily regard underlying learning and course objectives. Having said the above, for me they would be: assessments and content. Re assessments, they're similar to traditional schools that have students memorize dates, names, etc. I guess that checks my memorization skills, but it takes away the focus I would have loved to have in actually trying to achieve the goals of a course, which are usually ""to understand and be able to apply something"". There are subjects that do this well (ex. EAPP-111 - the application of the modules in sentence structure), and others that I honestly find ridiculous (eg. ICT-112 - memorizing the headers of a website's column that were not mentioned in the module. I don't think we are expected to pay attention and memorize all words in a web page. It's not part of the course objective, and there's just no point to it as these are just titles to make the interface more user-friendly and have no importance in the learning outcome.) On another note, in HMRM-111, the activities had no mention of a grading system. There were questions, and I answered them based on my opinion. I don't know how my opinion was graded, or how the way I sang the hymn was checked. In general, the content, in my opinion, is really good in most subjects. There are some that are a bit overloaded (eg. ELSC-111 - videos are too long; PHIL-121 - we're supposed to read the references as well, without notice). There are those that are, I would say, quite imposing without sufficient grounds or are only based on a single/limited viewpoint (eg. ""These are the best ways to do something""), or things that are not definite and still has some relativity in them such as ""Chinese are better at business or at math than Filipinos"". Again, I'm not an expert, but these kind of content might limit inquisitive and reasoning abilities.",Mentor,Mentors Helpfullness ,,
2019,"I think proper coordination with the different department should be improve, because based on my experience during every enrollment, there is no coordination between the Students Support, Finance/Account Department and Content Developing Team. Sometimes, they are providing a different answers that made me confused. And since I'm in a new curriculum, they should at least ready the next subjects that the student should take because I'm always experiencing to have a 3 subjects first then I waited a few days to have a full loads of 8 subjects. While a student is currently enrolled, at least they should be preparing the next subjects so that they can give a full load and follow the curriculum on time. This is such a great help for us who wants to finish their degree as soon as possible.",Mentor,Mentors Helpfullness ,,
2019,"I think it would be better if there is a chat support assistance that you can set-up. Sometimes, it takes a while for you to respond through email. Also, kindly check the activities within the day after requesting for checking. We value your time, and we hope that you value our time as well. Please don't let us bombard you with emails asking for the activities to be checked. Kindly do it promptly. Also, the exams can be improved. Make sure that the directions are clearly stated. Also, the algorithms should allow multiple correct answers, ie., abbreviations and complete terms(mm or millimeter).",Mentor,Mentors Helpfullness ,,

And, I may add, lively voices as well. Moreover, course modules should match both the corresponding video lecture and presentation. Based on my experience, for example in PHYED6102, the video lecture was very short but there were a lot of information that needs to tackle based on the course module of the day.

2019,~not all materials have videos which can be challenging for mathematical subjects ~a way to contact a mentor for each subject will be good ~forums where students can interact and discuss would be good ~notice one subject so far that has the same presentation slide for 2 different topics (already reported and waiting for resolution) ~would be good to show questions wherein the student missed out in order to revisit/review,Mentor,Mentors Helpfullness ,,
2019,I hope you can reconsider adding modules instead or youtube videos instead as those that came from linda and other platform is hard to to watch due to slow internet and for some reason its also taking minutes to load. Like me I usually used tablet and have no strong internet connection but really like to study so there are times that I still have to rent on computer shops.I hope the videos are more easier to play and access on a platform.,Mentor,Mentors Helpfullness ,,
2019,The communication between student to mentors. It is a MUST.,Mentor,Mentors Helpfullness ,,
2019,"Some subjects need more preferences lije powerpoints because the manuals are not enough, just for better understanding of the subject.",Mentor,Mentors Helpfullness ,,

2021,"I think that the lack of community is a bad thing for us. If there's an option inside the LMS where students who are studying the same subject can interact with each other, it will be very lively. We can exchange ideas and collaborate. A community will not be a community unless it has variety. So maybe clubs can also be allowed in the LMS so it's official. This way, we can also connect with other students and exchange ideas that will make us feel that there are people who are like us. It's a bit unsatisfactory to associate logging in to LMS as something you need to do because you just need it. Unlike when I was in physical school, knowing that there are people inside the classroom, my attitude towards learning is boosted. I feel competition, I feel belongingness, I feel sympathy and many more. It's not just learning that I associate a school back then, it's also a backyard where we can practice dealing with other people.

Coming from another university where I also requested these documents, the fee of Good Moral Certificate(e.g) soft copy alone is already P565 here in OEd. Another fee of P600 is to be paid for a hard copy. That also means, another fee for Honorable Dismissal, TOR, etc for both soft and hard copies of the said document. I feel liked I am being charged double for something that has already cost too much. In comparison with my previous university (private), I only paid P600 pesos for all credentials already (TOR, Cert of Transfer, Good Moral).

Another fee of P600 is to be paid for a hard copy. That also means, another fee for Honorable Dismissal, TOR, etc for both soft and hard copies of the said document. I feel liked I am being charged double for something that has already cost too much. In comparison with my previous university (private), I only paid P600 pesos for all credentials already (TOR, Cert of Transfer, Good Moral).
